        <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
        <h2>Learning Web Development</h2>
        <h3>Building Skills Step by Step</h3>

        <p>
          This is my very first webpage built using basic HTML. It includes
          headings, paragraphs, and an image link as part of the foundational
          structure.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am learning how websites are created from scratch. Understanding the
          building blocks of HTML is the first step toward becoming a great web
          developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this project, I am practicing how to structure text content and
          format it properly using standard HTML tags. Each element has a
          purpose and meaning.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I continue this journey, I hope to acquire more skills in front-end
          and back-end development, ultimately becoming confident in full-stack
          engineering.
        </p>
